### Overview
Include overview here:  As an artist and retailer of handmade jewelry, handmade knives and mineral specimens dealer, I have a hard time taking care of my business the way I should.  Things like keeping track of paperwork is hard to manage which would help me track vendor costs and come up with accurate pricing or even having time to research competitors and their pricing.  My business is amidst a transition with a new launch of my website along with ecommerce capabliities and to fully release and launch I need to upload all of my stock!  My web developer needs me to provide information and product pictures to him as fast as I can to in order to stay up to date.    It's a lot to manage and I don't have much time to do market research, keep my website and developer updated as well as staying on top of industry trends and competitors.  

My web based application will be a one stop place for any artist or retailer of any variety to store data, use that data and turn that data into a useful tool for communication.  The artist/retailer will create a profile login id and password unique to them.  They can designate one other person to have limited permissions and to create their own unique login and password.  Their profile will be attached to the main Artist's profile.  

Enter and store information/data such as purchases and vendor contact/information.   Where you can store itemized receipts and assign categories or labels to the items purchased, and add vendor information.  This information will be searchable and can be filtered by category/columns and obviously by totals, vendors, and dates.  It could be useful if you have vendor notes to add too, like spouse's name, funny stories, etc...

Users can upload photos of completed work, add description and import materials used into a formula that helps create retail and wholesale prices.  This is especially useful for communicating to anyone helping maintain your website.  It also creates an inventory tracker 



provide the much needed information useful to everyone involved with my business.  Once I create an online profile I can start capturing my data in a cusstomizable way.  I will be able to enter pruchases and vendors and if i make createions rfrom those I cdan enter photos and information that are going to help me figure out my acutal costs.  Wit hother artists signing on to this onlinefeature database, i can compare my prices with theirs and for an upgraded memebership fee I can ge much more detailed inforamtion   This application will keep tracking records and run on the CRUD funcitonality for store important data that only needs to be entered once.
