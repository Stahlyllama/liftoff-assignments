## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here: 
As an artist and retailer of handmade jewelry, handmade knives and mineral specimens dealer, I have a hard time taking care of my business the way I should.  Things like keeping track of paperwork or entering vendor information tends to be difficult and something I can barely find the time for.   I have always wanted a one stop shop sort of place that would help me store vendors, their contact information, and my material costs.  With fluctuating silver market prices, it would be nice to compare what I have paid in the past to what they are asking now which would ultimately help me to come up with accurate pricing.  In addition as my business is transitioning to online retail with a new launch of my website my web developer needs me to provide information and product pictures to him as fast as I can to in order to stay up to date.    It's a lot to manage and I don't have much time to do separate communications with him as I also struggle to do market research and try to stay on top of industry trends and competitors and their pricing.  

### Features
Include Features here: 
My web based application will be a one stop place for any artist or retailer of any variety to store their data and turn that data into a useful tool for communication, tracking, inventory, and more.  The artist/retailer will create a profile login id and password unique to them.  Their profile would also include options for identifying themselves by choosing from a list of categories for vendor type.  They can designate one other person to have limited permissions and to create their own unique login and password.  Their profile will be attached to the main Artist's profile.
The vendor type would be used for other features later, like membership levels unlock more about their competitors that would use this app.  So Jewelry artists could find what other jewelry artists prices for their pieces might cost at free level, but could have tiered membership to see their photos and more information revealed.  

Enter and store information/data such as purchases and vendor contact/information.   Where you can store itemized receipts and assign categories or labels to the items purchased, and add vendor information.  This information will be searchable and can be filtered by category/columns and obviously by totals, vendors, and dates.  It could be useful if you have vendor notes to add too, like spouse's name, funny stories, etc...
This part of the tool would be great when making additional purchases or comparing costs of materials.  As membership levels might be added later, maybe vendors used by other artists of the same "type" - could reveal their sources.  

Users can upload photos of completed work, add description and import materials used into a formula that helps create retail and wholesale prices.  This is especially useful for communicating to anyone helping maintain your website.  It also creates an inventory database and assists with online purchases with notifications that an item(s) have been purchased and the next step would be to ship or arrange pickup.  This feature would work similar or directly work with paypal and usps/ups shipping and tracking info.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to learn all of the things mentioned above as I only have had small encounters with programming things like login / password creation.  It's all so new, but I intend to master these concepts fully.
